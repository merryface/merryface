### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub account! Did you know that you can have a README.md on your landing page if you create a repo with the same name as your account? Pretty cool, right?

This GitHub page is still a work in process, but here's what I got so far!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all Grav as well as more API and authentication interactions with React
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advanced React use and WordPress
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me where I'm from!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [tarikmerrylees@gmail.com](mailto:tarikmerrylees@gmail.com)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Him/His, but I won't get offended if you get it wrong.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I rock climbed the [Sugar Loaf mountain in Rio de Janeiro](https://pixabay.com/images/id-1142548/), twice!

# Some of My Work
## [Teemz](https://github.com/teemz-app)
[Teemz](https://github.com/teemz-app) is a react football team generator, where the user can set the number of players per team, give the teams a name, and then save a match's result in a database. Users can also add new players into the database, as well as access a list of all players and all saved matches. The app uses Axios to make RESTful API requests.

## [Alpocalypso](https://github.com/merryface/Alpacalyptic)
An Alpaca rental website (yes you read that right), [Alpocalypso](https://github.com/merryface/Alpacalyptic) is a group project where users can choose between several Alpacas, each of which have a special talent. Click on the random alpaca fact in the header at your own risk (if your sound is on in any case). Warning: website may in fact, not actually rent out real alpacas.

## [Appy Wrapping](https://github.com/appy-wrapping)
is the perfect tool for someone who is in the habit of losing shopping lists around christmas time. [Appy Wrapping](https://github.com/appy-wrapping) is a Christmas shopping list app where you can add presents and their costs, and whether you have purchased them or not. if you exceed your set budget, the total cost turns red. Merry Christmas!
